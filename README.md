<H2>Duplicate Mac Provisioning Flash Disk (Multiple Flash Drive version)</H2>

*** Danger, this can be a destructive script, read below fully, not responsible for data loss!!! ***

This is a niche quick and dirty script for those wanting to speed up the process of duplicating Mac Provisioning USB Flash drives for Reimaging Apple/Mac computers. If you do not know what Mac Provisioner is (tool provided by Apple) you do not need this. Why did I do this? I needed a quicker way to mass duplicate Mac Provisioner created USB drives for technicians in RCS. The Mac Provisioner creates a multi-partition drive that you can option boot a MacBook/iMac/other and automatically install macOS. (Brief desc.) I did not right off find an easy way to seamlessly duplicate the multi-partition drive. Single partition can be easily duplicated with Disk Utility/other GUI utilities but from what I found not multi-partition (at the time of this writing). This script is looped, unmounts and asks you if you want to do another after duplication is finished.

Instructions: Make sure your partitions are correct by using "diskutil list" with your disk media below mounted and USB flash drive. Make sure you change the MacProvImageLoc to the dmg name you create. Mac Provisioner can create erase installs and upgrade installs so I name the dmg appropriately. You create the DMG file AFTER you create a USB flash drive with Mac Provisioner to your liking. In disk utility GUI you can dismount the USB drive (both partitions) then right click on the dismounted flash drive inside disk utility and create a DMG file (will create both partitions inside the file). Email me if needed. You could in theory use this for any multi-partition duplication from DMG to USB flash drives, edit for your own purposes. Danger, /dev locations must be modified for your Mac/setup, if not you could destroy a partition!!! You have been warned!

To run from macOS terminal:

sudo sh DuplicateMacProvisionDiskImg.sh
